|VOLTTRON Tagline|

|VOLTTRON| is an open-source platform for distributed sensing and control.  The platform is an open source tool for
performing simulations, improving building system performance, and creating a more flexible and reliable power grid.


Features
========

- a secure :ref:`message bus <messagebus index>` allowing connectivity between modules on individual platforms and
  between platform instances in large scale deployments
- a flexible :ref:`agent framework <Agent-Framework>` allowing users to adapt the platform to their unique use-cases
- a configurable :ref:`driver framework <VOLTTRON-Driver-Framework>` for collecting data from and sending control
  signals to buildings and devices
- automatic data capture and retrieval through our :ref:`historian framework <Historian Index>`
- an extensible :ref:`web framework <Web-Framework>` allowing users and services to securely connect to the platform
  from anywhere

VOLTTRONâ„¢ is open source and publicly available from `GitHub <https://github.com/volttron/volttron.git>`_. The project
is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and receives ongoing updates from a team of core developers at PNNL.  The
VOLTTRON team encourages and appreciates community involvement including issues and pull requests on Github, meetings
at our bi-weekly office-hours and on Slack. To be invited to office-hours or slack, please `send the team an email
<volttron@pnnl.gov>`_.
