=========================
Driver Framework Overview
=========================

VOLTTRON drivers act as an interface between agents on the platform and a device.  While running on the platform,
drivers are special purpose agents which instead of being run as a separate process, are run as a greenlet in the
Master Driver process.

Driver instances are created by the Master Driver when a new driver configuration is added to the configuration store.
Drivers use the following topic pattern `devices/<campus>/<building>/<device id>`.  When a configuration file is added
to the Master Driver's store using this pattern, the Master Driver creates a Driver Agent.  The Driver agent is in turn
instantiated with a instance of the Interface class corresponding to the `driver_type` parameter in the configuration
file.  The Interface class is responsible for implementing the communication paradigms of a device or protocol.  Once
configured, the Master Driver periodically polls the Driver Agent for data which is collected from the interface class.
Additionally, points can be requested ad-hoc via the Master Driver's JSON-RPC method "get_point". Points may be set
by using JSON-RPC with the Actuator agent to set up a schedule and calling the "set_point" method.


Driver Conventions
******************

-  Drivers are polled by the Master Driver agent and values can be set using the `Actuator Agent`
-  Drivers should have a 1-to-1 relationship with a device
-  Driver modules should be written in Python files in the `services/core/MasterDriverAgent/master_driver/interfaces`
   directory in the VOLTTRON repository.  The master driver will search for a Python file in this directory matching the
   name provided by the `driver_type` value from the driver configuration when creating the Driver agent.
-  Driver code consists of an Interface class (exactly named), supported in most cases by one or more Register classes


.. _Driver_Communication:

Agent-Driver Communication Patterns
***********************************

The VOLTTRON message bus has been developed to allow agents on the platform to interact with each other, as well as with
ICS (Industrial Control Systems) and IOT (Internet of Things) devices via the VOLTTRON driver framework. Agents and
drivers have the ability to publish data to the message bus and to subscribe to message bus topics to read in data as it
is published. Additionally, agents may implement JSONRPC calls and expose JSONRPC endpoints to communicate more directly
with other agents. The following diagram demonstrates typical platform communication patterns for a single platform
deployment.


Typical Single Platform Behavior
================================

.. |Single Platform Communication Pattern| image:: files/driver_data_flow.png

The diagram features several entities that comprise the platform and its connected components:

* The VOLTTRON message bus - The message bus is the means of transmission of information in VOLTTRON. The VOLTTRON
  message bus is built around existing message bus software; currently VOLTTRON supports RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ. The
  VOLTTRON integration includes Pub/Sub and JSON RPC interfaces for agent and driver communication.
* VOLTTRON Platform Agents and Subsystems - These agents and subsystems are installed on the platform to manage the
  platform. They provide many user facing functions, aid in communication and manage other agents and drivers.
* User's Agents - These agents are either agents included in the core repository but installed by a user, or user built
  agent modules. They may perform a huge variety of user specified tasks, including data collection, device control,
  simulation, etc.
* Master Driver Agent - This agent is installed by a user to facilitate communication with drivers. Drivers should not
  communicated with directly - the master driver implements several features for communicating with drivers to ensure
  smooth operation and consistent driver behavior.
* Actuator agent - This agent is installed by user to provide scheduling capability for controlling drivers. The master
  driver does not include protections for race conditions, etc. It is always recommended to use the Actuator agent to
  set values on a device.
* Device Driver - Drivers are special purpose agents which provide an interface between the master driver and devices
  such as Modbus, and BACnet devices. Drivers implement a specific set of features for protecting device communication
  ensuring uniform behaviors across different devices.
* Device - Devices may be low level physical computers for controlling various systems such as PLCs (Programmable Logic
  Controller), devices which communicate on the local network (such as a Smart T.V.), or devices which are accessed via
  a remote web API (other smart devices).


Lines of Communication
----------------------

Connectivity of the platform follows the following paradigm:

* Platform agents (including the Master Driver and Actuator), subsystems, and user agents communicate with the message
  bus via a publish/subscribe system.
* Agents can communicate "directly" to each other via JSONRPC calls - JSONRPC calls use the VOLTTRON message bus router
  to "direct" messages to an intended recipient. RPC calls from an agent specify a function for the recipient to
  perform including input parameters, and the response to the sender should contain the value output by the specified
  function.
* The Master Driver will periodically poll device drivers. This functionality is intentionally not user-facing. The
  Master Driver iterates over the configured drivers and calls their respective "scrape_all" methods. This will trigger
  the drivers to collect point values.
* The Driver will communicate with its configured end devices to collect data points which it then returns to the
  driver. The driver then publishes the point data to the bus under the `<campus>/<building>/<device id>/all` topic.
* To get an individual device point, the user agent should send an RPC call to the Master Driver for "get_point",
  providing the point's corresponding topic. After the Master Driver processes the request, communication happens very
  similarly to polling, but rather than an "all" publish, the data is returned via the Master Driver to the user agent.
* To set a point on a device, it is recommended to use an Actuator Agent. The user agent sends an RPC request to the
  Actuator to schedule time for the agent to control the device. During that scheduled time the user agent may send it
  a set point request. If the schedule has been created, the actuator will then forward that request to the Master
  Driver, at which point the communication happens similarly to a "get_point" request.

The general paradigm for the device-driver relationship as specified by the VOLTTRON driver framework is a 1-to-1
relationship. Each end device should be interacted with via a single device driver configured on one platform. To
distribute device data, the DataPuller and forwarder agents can be used at the platform level. Multiple platforms are
not intended to collect data or share control of a single device.


Special Case Drivers
====================

Some drivers require a different communication paradigm. One common alternative is shown in the diagram below:

.. |Driver Proxy Pattern| image:: files/proxy_driver_data_flow.png

This example describes an alternative pattern wherein BACnet drivers communicate via a BACnet proxy agent to communicate
with end devices. This behavior is derived from the networking requirements of the BACnet specification. BACnet
specifies a star topology for a given network; "slave" devices in a BACnet network communicate with a single "master".
In this case, the BACnet proxy acts as a virtual BACnet master, and device drivers forward their requests to this agent
which then performs the BACnet communication (whereas the typical pattern would have devices communicate directly with
the corresponding device). There are many other situations which may require this paradigm to be adopted (such as
working with remote APIs with request limits), and it is up to the party implementing the driver to determine if this
pattern or another pattern may be the most appropriate implementation pattern for their respective use case.


Installing the Fake Driver
**************************

The Fake Driver is included as a way to quickly see data published to the message bus in a format that mimics what a
true driver would produce.  This is a simple implementation of the VOLTTRON driver framework.

See :ref:`instructions for installing the fake driver <Fake-Driver-Install>`

To view data being published from the fake driver on the message bus, one can
:ref:`install the Listener Agent <Listener-Agent>` and read the VOLTTRON log file:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd <root volttron directory>
    tail -f volttron.log
