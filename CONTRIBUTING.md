# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute back to Volttron! We really appreciate it.

We have a lengthy [Guide to Contributions](https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/develop/community_resources/contributing.html) on our ReadTheDocs site, where all of our documentation lives. This guide focuses on helpful instructions for newcomers to GitHub and Git.

For more experienced GitHub users, the main things to keep in mind are:
- We use `develop` as the active development branch, and not `master`. Please submit PRs to `develop` by default.
- There are no tests you need to run as a contributor before submitting a PR. While we use TravisCI for some minor testing of the Docker container, as a whole, Volttron does not have tests.
- You do not need to lint your Python code. But try and follow the general style used elsewhere.
- You do not need to build documentation changes when submitting doc fixes.

Thank you.
